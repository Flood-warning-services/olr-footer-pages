			<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">This phone number has been automatically opted-in to receive flood warnings</h1>
			<p>In England, the Environment Agency sends flood warnings to phone numbers registered in areas at risk of flooding from rivers or the sea. The service is anonymous and free.</p>
			<div class="govuk-inset-text">
				<p>You can provide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/edw-ur">feedback on this service.</a></p>
			</div>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why did we send you this message?</h2>
			<p>We have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others">legal duty</a> to warn people who may be at risk of flooding so they can take action to protect themselves, their family and property.</p>
			<p>This phone number was automatically added to the list of numbers to which we send flood warnings. This is because it was registered in an area that’s at risk of flooding in the future and that may have flooded in the past.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How did we get your number?</h2>
			<p>We tell phone companies about areas at risk of flooding. They send us a list of the phone numbers registered in those areas.</p>
			<p>They do not give us the names or addresses associated with those numbers. We store the numbers securely, in line with our <a class="govuk-link" href="/docs/privacy-notice-new">privacy notice.</a></p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you need to do anything?</h2>
			<p>You can choose to fully register your details or stop receiving flood warnings. If you do nothing, your phone will continue to automatically receive local flood warnings whenever they are issued.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to fully register your details</h3>
			<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fws.environment-agency.gov.uk/app/olr/register">fully register your details</a> to get the best experience of the flood warning service. The service is free.</p>
			<p>You can register more than one phone number. You can also choose to be sent:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>flood alerts, which indicate that flooding is possible</li>
				<li>warnings and alerts by text message, recorded voice message, or email</li>
				<li>warnings and alerts about more than one location</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to stop receiving flood warnings</h3>
			<p>To opt out of the service, you can do any of the following.</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>send an email, including your phone number, to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk">enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk</a></li>
				<li>text ‘REMOVE’ to 60006, using the phone which received the original text</li>
				<li>call Floodline on 0345 988 1188 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/call-charges">call charges</a> may apply)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your number will be removed from the service and you will no longer receive warnings of potential floods.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What the flood warnings mean</h2>
			<p>We issue 3 levels of flood warning:</p>
			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Flood alert</h3>
			<img src="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/public/images/flood-alerts-icon.gif" width="137" height="129" alt="The flood alert symbol - a triangle with orange border showing flood water at the base of a building">
			<p>A flood alert means you need to prepare as flooding is possible. If you haven’t already done so, you should:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fws.environment-agency.gov.uk/app/olr/register">sign up for flood warnings</a></li>
				<li>keep up to date with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings">latest flood risk situation</a></li>
				<li>have a bag ready with vital items like insurance documents and medications in case you need to leave your home</li>
				<li>check you know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water mains supplies</li>
				<li>plan how you'll move family and pets to safety</li>
			  </ul>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Flood warning</h3>
			<img src="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/public/images/flood-warnings-icon.gif" width="137" height="129" alt="The flood warning symbol - a triangle with red border showing flood water halfway up a building">
			<p>A flood warning means you need to act as flooding is expected. You should do all the actions for a flood alert, but also:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>move vehicles to higher ground if it’s safe to do so</li>
				<li>move family and pets to safety</li>
				<li>move important items upstairs or to a safe place in your property, starting with cherished items and valuables, then furniture and furnishings</li>
				<li>turn off gas, electricity and water supplies if it’s safe to do so; never touch an electrical switch if you’re standing in water</li>
				<li>if you have property protection products such as flood barriers, or air brick covers, use them now</li>
			  </ul>

			  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Severe flood warning</h3>
			  <img src="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/public/images/severe-flood-warnings-icon.gif" width="137" height="129" alt="The severe flood warning symbol - a triangle with red border showing flood water at the top of a building">
			  <p>A severe flood warning means there is danger to life and you must act now.</p>
			  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				  <li>call 999 if you’re in immediate danger</li>
				  <li>follow advice from the emergency services and evacuate if you’re told to do so</li>
				  <li>make sure you have an emergency kit including a torch, spare batteries, mobile phone and charger, warm clothes, important numbers like your home insurance, water, food, first aid kit and any medicines and babycare items you may need</li>
				  <li>alert neighbours and offer help if it's safe to do so</li>
				  <li>avoid driving or walking through flood water: just 30cm (1 foot) of fast flowing water could move your car and even shallow moving water can knock you off your feet</li>
				  <li>keep your family and pets away from floodwater – it may contain heavy debris, sharp objects, open manhole covers, sewage and chemicals</li>
				  <li>wash your hands if you’ve been in contact with flood water which may contain toxic substances	</li>
				</ul>
			   <p>All floods are different and you should take advice from the emergency services and your local authority if you’re in a flood.</p>
