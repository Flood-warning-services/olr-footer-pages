			<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy notice</h1>
			<p>These are the standards you can expect from the Environment Agency when we collect, hold or use your personal information when you use our service.</p>
			<p>We do this in line with data protection law, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>
			<p>The Environment Agency is the data controller for the Flood Warning System in England. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> explains your rights and how we deal with your personal information.</p>
			<p>Natural Resources Wales use the same system and are the data controller if you ask for a service in Wales. To read about how Natural Resources Wales uses your personal information go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://naturalresources.wales/footer-links/privacy-notice/?lang=en">naturalresources.wales/privacy</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect</h2>
			<p>If you register with us, the personal data we collect about you includes:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>name</li>
				<li>contact details</li>
				<li>address or locations of interest for which you would like to receive warnings</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Cookies and analytics</h3>
			<p>Read our full <a class="govuk-link" href="/docs/cookies">cookie notice</a> to find out how we use cookies.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your personal data</h2>
			<p>We may use your personal information to:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>send you the warnings you have signed up for</li>
				<li>send you a small number of service announcements or administrative messages</li>
				<li>help emergency services and local councils respond to flooding</li>
				<li>help with our work on flood warning and flood risk management</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How we work with phone companies</h3>
			<p>We have a legal duty under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others">Civil Contingencies Act</a> to maintain arrangements to warn people who may be at risk of flooding. The lawful basis for processing your personal data is to perform a task in the public interest that is set out in law.</p>
			<p>We work with phone companies to obtain phone numbers for addresses where there is no customer registered for the flood warning service. We tell phone companies the unregistered addresses at risk of flooding and they send us a list of the phone numbers registered to those addresses. They do not give us the names or addresses associated with those numbers.</p>
			<p>The phone number will stop being sent flood warnings if the phone companies no longer provide us with the phone number. This might happen if:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>you change or cancel your phone number</li>
				<li>you move house</li>
				<li>we change the areas that we provide warnings to</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>
			<p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>

			<p>Your personal information is stored and processed securely on servers in the UK.</p>
					
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who your data might be shared with</h2>
			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Third party service providers</h3>			
			<p>We may share your information with our agents or representatives, so they can manage your account. Our agents or representatives will only use your personal data in line with what we have set out in this privacy notice.</p>
			<p>We will not:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
				<li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Legal obligations</h3>			
			<p>We may share your data or disclose information because of a law, regulation or court order and to protect our interests and legal rights.</p>
						
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>
			<p>We will keep your personal data for as long as your account is active, and for 6 years from the date that your flood warnings account is cancelled. This is in line with our retention policy.</p>
			<p>We need to keep your details so that we can stop your phone number from being automatically added to the service again after you cancel your account. After 6 years, we will no longer have a record that you cancelled your account and your phone number could be automatically added again.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Changes to this policy</h2>
			<p>We may change this privacy notice. In that case, the ‘last updated’ date at the bottom of this page will also change. Any changes to this privacy notice will apply to you and your data immediately.</p>
			<p>We encourage you to review this privacy notice regularly to find out how we are protecting your data. </p>
