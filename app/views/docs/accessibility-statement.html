			<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement</h1>
			<p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement applies to the Sign up for flood warnings service.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">This website is run by the Environment Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
				<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
				<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="govuk-body">The text should be clear and simple to understand.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this website is</h2>
			<p class="govuk-body">The majority of this website is accessible, and users should be able to register to get flood warning information, and update or cancel existing registrations. The service uses the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> styles, components and patterns.</p>
			
			<p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>skipped heading levels on some pages</li>
				<li>the register postcode/address table has empty table header for formatting reasons</li>
				<li>the map and sign-up links on ‘Areas you can get warnings for’ use the same link text</li>
				<li>maps showing the extent of the flood warning and flood alert areas</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="govuk-body">We plan to fix these issues with a new version of this service, which we are currently developing. We are aiming for it to be fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">You can also call Floodline who can register you to the service, update your existing details and cancel your account.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
