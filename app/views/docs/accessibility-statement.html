			<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement</h1>
			<p>This accessibility statement applies to the Sign up for flood warnings service on GOV.UK.</p>
			<p>This website is run by the Environment Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
				<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
				<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The text should be clear and simple to understand.</p>
			<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this website is</h2>
			<p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>maps</li>
				<li>skipped heading levels on some pages</li>
				<li>the register postcode address table has empty table header for formatting reasons</li>
				<li>the map and signup links on ‘Areas you can get warnings for’ use the same link text - it would be better to include the area name as hidden text to better distinguish them</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We plan to fix these issues with a new version of this service, which we are currently developing. We are aiming for it to be fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
			<p>In the meantime, if there is any content on the website that you need but cannot access, please contact us to request it in a different format.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Feedback and contact information</h2>
			<p>If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille:</p>

				<li>call us on 03708 506 506 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm)</li>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
			<p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk">enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk</a></p>
			
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
			<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).</a></p>
			
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
			<p>The Environment Agency is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>
			<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard due to the following non-compliances and exemptions.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-accessible content</h3>
			<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
			
			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
			<p>TBC</p>
			
			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h3>
			<p>Our maps are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website.</p>
			<p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in December 2022.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
			<p>The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>maps</li>
				<li>third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
			<p>We are currently working on a new, more accessible version of this website that fixes the issues listed here.</p>
			<p>We plan to:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>undertake several internal and external accessibility audits throughout the development of the new website</li>
				<li>test the content for readability and usability with existing and new users</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We intend to make sure the new website is fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
