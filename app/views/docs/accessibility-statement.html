			<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement</h1>
			<p>This accessibility statement applies to the Sign up for flood warnings service.</p>
			<p>This website is run by the Environment Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
				<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
				<li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
				<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The text should be clear and simple to understand.</p>
			<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this website is</h2>
			<p>The majority of this website is accessible, and users should be able to register to get flood warning information, and update or cancel existing registrations.</p>
			
			<p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>skipped heading levels on some pages</li>
				<li>the register postcode/address table has empty table header for formatting reasons</li>
				<li>the map and sign-up links on ‘Areas you can get warnings for’ use the same link text</li>
				<li>maps</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We plan to fix these issues with a new version of this service, which we are currently developing. We are aiming for it to be fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
			<p>You can also call Floodline who can register you to the service, update your existing details and cancel your account.</p>
			<div class="govuk-inset-text">
				<p><b>Floodline</b></p>
				<ul class="govuk-list">

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>
			<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard due to the following non-compliances and exemptions.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-accessible content</h3>
			<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
			
			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>Some pages include heading levels that are skipped. This may cause issues with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels).</li>
				<li>The postcode/address table has an empty table header for formatting reasons. This may cause issues with assistive technology because it has blank headings. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (information and relationships).</li>
				<li>Some links use the same link text. This may cause issues with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (link purpose).</li>
				<li>Some pages have a map that is not labeled correctly, which affects how it works with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.1.2 (no keyboard trap) and 4.1.2 (name, role, value).</li>
			</ul>				
			
			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h3>
			<p>Not applicable.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
			<p>The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses</li>
				<li>maps</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
			<p>We are currently working on a new, more accessible version of this website that fixes the issues listed here.</p>
			<p>We plan to:</p>
			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>undertake several internal and external accessibility audits throughout the development of the new website</li>
				<li>test the content for readability and usability with existing and new users</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We intend to make sure the new website is fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
			<p>This statement was prepared on 12 July 2021. It was last reviewed on 12 July 2021.</p>
			<p>This website was last tested on 1 May 2021. The test was carried out internally.</p>
			<p>We chose a sample of pages that are representative of all areas of the service and used our knowledge of the service to prioritise the order of testing by the likelihood of finding issues.</p>
